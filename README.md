# color-game
A game that explains Stroop's effect where people have difficulty with naming the color of the ink of the word rather than the word itself.

Used python to make a game where people simply look at colour words, such as blue, red, or green. The interesting thing is that the task is to name the colour of the ink the words are printed in, while fully ignoring the actual word meaning. The words themselves have a strong influence over your ability to say the colour. The interference between the different information (what the words say and the colour of the words) your brain receives causes a problem called 'The Stroop effect'. 

The effects observed in the game provide a clear illustration of peopleâ€™s capacity for selective attention and the ability of some stimuli to escape attention control. 

This game is widely used in cognitive psychology.

Modules used :- tkinter, random
